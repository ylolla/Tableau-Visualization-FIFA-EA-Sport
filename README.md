# Tableau-Project
 
 The current project provides visualizations for FIFA E-Sport 17-22 data.
 
 This Tableau visualization will use the statistical information of soccer players featuring in the FIFA game which combines the cross-sectional data from 2017 to 2022. 
 In this visualization, we will use the dataset available on Kaggle, which contains information on 104K+ players with 63 attributes. 
 The data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/bryanb/fifa-player-stats-database/version/29?select=FIFA17_official_data.csv.
